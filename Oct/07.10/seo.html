        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
        surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
        display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
