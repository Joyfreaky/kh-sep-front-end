Compiled Languages. (Java, Python, Go) => High Level languages.
    => Translates Java into Machine Level Language.

Interpreted language.
    => HTML. 
    => Browser parses HTML 
        (to check syntaxes, grammars.)


Machine Level Language - [Apple, Intel, AMD]


// high level
System.out.println("Hello");
console.log("Hello");

Intel -> READ, WRITE, PRINT, HOLD, RUN.

Java.

Compiler Types: AOT, JIT.

JIT ()

// machine level
PRINT "Hello";

AOT

1. Write a Java Program.
2. Converting in machine language.
3. Faster.
4. Not Platform independent (C, C++, C# without .net core.)


JIT:
1. Write a program.
2. RUn on machine.
3. Compiled just before running.
4. Java (JVM), JS, Go, C#(.NET)
5. Java Runtime. JRE, .NET , NodeJS.


Agenda.

1. Complete Form. - Done.
2. More Tags - Div, span, a, 
3. HTML5
4. Inline vs Block level element.
5. What is an element. elements vs tags


What is Element ?
    => From opening tag to closing tag area.

Inline Element.
    => Occupies ui space as much as it needs.
    => Inline elements can start on same line if there are space.
    => Can't give height/width to inline element.

Block Level Element.
    => Occupies entire line.
    => Starts on new line.
    => change height and width.
